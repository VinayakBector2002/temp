# Project *PEER_PROOF* by TimeTraveling Serpents 
## Goal: Create a platform for high school students to post their solutions to math textbook questions or challenging math problems and have other students provide feedback and comment on them

Our project is a website that allows high school students to improve their mathematical communication skills. Students can post their detailed solutions to math textbook questions or problem solving questions, and other students can provide helpful feedback or ask questions about their solutions. Specific sections can be highlighted for reference when adding a comment, and a point system encourages students to provide constructive, critical feedback to each other's solutions. A rating system also allows students see how well-communicated other students find their solutions. Quizzes, articles and other resources are linked on the website for additional learning opportunities to balance practicing technical skills alongside communication skills.

### The Motivation Behind This Project

It is easy for students to become so focused on finding the right answer to a math problem that they completely neglect the presentation of solution. Oftentimes, an elegantly communicated solution is just as, if not more, important than the final answer. To encourage the clear communication of students' problem solving process, *PEER PROOF*'s learning platform puts emphasizes on the clarity, concision, and elegance of written solutions; it does this through a student-teach-student learning model. Recieving and providing good criticism teaches students on both sides the ways that they can improve how they write their solutions to problems. The benefit of a student-based learning system is that students can point out each other's mistakes while reflecting on how those same mistakes appear in their own work. Sometimes seeing where other students get confused in your solution allows you to better understand where you may have made a mistake. (_If we have time_: To encourage healthy discussion and respectful criticism, comments containing good feedback can be given a _thumbs up_ and will appear at the top of discussions.) *PEER PROOF* facilitates group discussion between students, providing a platform for students to make mistakes and learn from them together.

### How to Use PEER PROOF
You can create an account through your gmail. Posted problems and their corresponding student solutions are organized by mathematical topic and subtopics. You can post a problem and your solution in the appropriate category or post your solution to an already posted problem. You're solutions don't have to be complete. Sometimes, showing what you've got so far and getting feedback on it can help guide you to the right path! 
Add comments to the posted solutions and highlight the sections that you are referring to. *PEER PROOF* keeps track of everytime you provide feedback, and you can __level up__ your "proofreading prowess" by giving enough good critics. Thumbs up other comments that you find constructive and they'll show up closer to the top.
Quizzes, articles and other resources are located on the homepage. Click the links to be brought to those sites. (*If we get there*: Students learn best when they are given ample time in between study session to relax and subconsciously process the information. Our built-in **Pomodoro Timer** will keep track of how long you're studying for and remind you when it's time to take a break. It'll be a welcomed companion alongside your mathematical exploration of our website).

### Challenges We Encountered
Don't worry, they're coming ... >:)

### Our Proud Accomplishments
I'm sure they're coming too... ('3')

### What We've Learned
The power of friendship conquers all.

### Future Project Extensions
Currently, this platform has focused its scope on mathematics; however, the same system can encourage strong communication skills in other subjects as well. More advanced features could include providing an easy way for users to add mathematical symbols and notations when typing out their solutions and adding pictures or screenshots of their work that can also be highlighted.
